# Developer Challenges

> A collection of _example_ solutions for the [Developer Challenges](https://blog.cloudflare.com/developer-week-challenges/).

Throughout Developer Week, we have offered a series of challenges to give you the excuse – or nudge – you may have needed to play with Cloudflare's products.

Within this repository, you'll find _example_ solutions for the challenges. Please note, these contents are meant to serve as reference material only. There are no right or wrong answers! The Developer Challenges were designed to be open-ended, so if your approach looks different – that's great!
